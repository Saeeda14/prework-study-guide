# <Prework study guide webpage>

## Description

My motivation was my will to be successfull. For me to explore a career that not only was in my interest but had a high demand too. I built this project to have a study guide which displayed all information in one place for better and easy access. I wont have to go back and forth between different modules to see the notes needed. While building this project, it allowed me to not only build a helpful study guide but also implement was I was studying.

## Usage

This study guide lists all the necessary topics needed to be able to build a webpage and have it successfully running. It consists notes on HTML, CSS, and Javascript. And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
